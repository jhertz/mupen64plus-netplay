-e Note that Mupen64Plus requires an Intel mac and will not run on PPC macs.
It is known to run on OS X 10.8; and most likely also runs on 10.7.

This application can NOT be opened in the Finder by double-clicking.
 To use, launch the terminal, then cd into the directory that contains mupen64plus.app and use a command like :

    $ ./run_rice.sh  example.v64        # for the Rice video plugin
    $ ./run_glide.sh  example.v64        # for the Glide64mk2 video plugin

    Note that at this point, the only way to configure Mupen64Plus is to edit the config files in ~/.config/mupen64plus

    If you cannot follow the instructions above then this package is not meant for you =)
